NKalish A1-Getting Started \
In this project I started a basic website that contained basic information about me \
To achieve some technical achievement I created buttons for my school and work experience \
To achieve some styling achievement I added style to the buttons, header, and background. \
To create the website run 'npm start' and go to localhost:3000
I tried to do an angular project but it kept crashing in glitch, but not locally. \
If you want to see that project it is in my branch called project 1.
